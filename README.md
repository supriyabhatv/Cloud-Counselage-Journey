**Creating Dashboard**
After preprocessing the data, I imported the preprocessed excel file into Power BI, a data visualization tool. Here are the steps I followed.

Charts, Graphs and Key Performance Indicators(KPIs):
- Column chart is used to represent the distributon of students over different graduation years.
- Using pie chart, visualized distribution of number of students over different graduation yeras.
- Clustered column chart is used to represent the variation of average of CGPA by expected salary and leadership skills.
- Pie chart is used to identify the total no of students atteneded data science related events.
- Using scatter chart, identified variation of avaerage salary(lacs) by CGPA.
- Donut chart is used to create distribution of promotional channnel bringing more students to the events.
- Horizontal Bar chart is used to represent the variation of expected salary by family income.
